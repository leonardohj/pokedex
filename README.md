# Pokedex tracker

Hi, this website was made out of boredom, kinda being an challenge with my school colleague (ruben), with the goal of being a pokedex tracker. This idea appeared when he did one pokedex tracker in C, and he wanted it to have an interface, so i decided to say - "why not make it an website?".

Well he liked the idea and then we started doing it, transforming it in a competition!

i'll write later the features of the website! >_<
